    <p>It's an opportunity to shout out the amazing work done by amazing women in the community, but also a chance hear from real people the how the role of a mother reflects in the lives of their children...from the children's persepective.

    <p>On a scale of 1(negative) - 5(positive), how would rate the impact of your mum in your life </p>
    <p>Write a quick lesson learned from your mum</p>
