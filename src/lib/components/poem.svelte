    <h2><em>Mother, A Cradle to Hold</em></h2>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <p>It is true<br>
I was created in you.<br>
It is also true<br>
That you were created for me.<br>
I owned your voice.<br>
It was shaped and tuned to soothe me.<br>
Your arms were molded<br>
Into a cradle to hold me, to rock me.<br>
The scent of your body was the air<br>
Perfumed for me to breathe.<br></p>

<p>Mother,<br>
During those early, dearest days<br>
I did not dream that you had<br>
A large life which included me,<br>
For I had a life<br>
Which was only you.<br></p>

<p>Time passed steadily and drew us apart.<br>
I was unwilling.<br>
I feared if I let you go<br>
You would leave me eternally.<br>
You smiled at my fears, saying<br>
I could not stay in your lap forever.<br>
That one day you would have to stand<br>
And where would I be?<br>
You smiled again.<br>
I did not.<br>
Without warning you left me,<br>
But you returned immediately.<br>
You left again and returned,<br>
I admit, quickly,<br>
But relief did not rest with me easily.<br>
You left again, but again returned.<br>
You left again, but again returned.<br>
Each time you reentered my world<br>
You brought assurance.<br>
Slowly I gained confidence.<br></p>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
<p>You thought you know me,<br>
But I did know you,<br>
You thought you were watching me,<br>
But I did hold you securely in my sight,<br>
Recording every moment,<br>
Memorizing your smiles, tracing your frowns.<br>
In your absence<br>
I rehearsed you,<br>
The way you had of singing<br>
On a breeze,<br>
While a sob lay<br>
At the root of your song.</p>

<p>
The way you posed your head<br>
So that the light could caress your face<br>
When you put your fingers on my hand<br>
And your hand on my arm,<br>
I was blessed with a sense of health,<br>
Of strength and very good fortune.<br></p>

<p>You were always<br>
the heart of happiness to me,<br>
Bringing nougats of glee,<br>
Sweets of open laughter.<br></p>
  </div>

  <div class="stanza">
<p>I loved you even during the years<br>
When you knew nothing<br>
And I knew everything, I loved you still.<br>
Condescendingly of course,<br>
From my high perch<br>
Of teenage wisdom.<br>
I spoke sharply of you, often<br>
Because you were slow to understand.<br>
I grew older and<br>
Was stunned to find<br>
How much knowledge you had gleaned.<br>
And so quickly.<br></p>

<p>To know I have learned nearly nothing.<br>
On this day<br>
When mothers are being honored,<br>
Let me thank you<br>
That my selfishness, ignorance, and mockery<br>
Did not bring you to<br>
Discard me like a broken doll<br>
Which had lost its favor.<br>
I thank you that<br>
You still find something in me<br>
To cherish, to admire and to love.<br></p>

<p>I thank you, Mother.<br>
I love you.‚Äù<br></p>
